# Billed

Billed is a SaaS solution for HR teams, currently used to manage professional invoices.

My mission on this project was to fix a series of bugs (listed [here](https://www.notion.so/a7a612fc166747e78d95aa38106a55ec)), to improve the test coverage (for `container/NewBill.js`, `container/Bills.js` and `views/Bills`) and to make an End-to-End test case for the user interface ( `plan E2E.pdf` ).


The quality of the code of the initial project is disastrous, the code is poorly organized, not very readable, little/no documentation, a lot of side effects and undocumented state-dependent elements...
I think that we should not write tests after the code got made, and even less when you aren't the original creator. The good practice, taught by OpenClassrooms in its courses, would be rather to realize the tests first when it is simpler to think about the different possibilities / errors / special cases...

In short, I invite you to not dig too much into the code of this repository üòÖ

**PROJECT GOALS**:
